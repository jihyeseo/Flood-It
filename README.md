# Flood It 

In development by Jihye Sofia Seo https://www.linkedin.com/in/jihyeseo
forked from the code of Al Sweigart  
http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter10.html 
whose books are very helpful for learning Python and PyGame. Many thanks!

Main change is that his version uses flood fill algorithm, which could not run for large boards.
This file modified the algorithm. 

 Flood-It is an NP hard problem http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4420 for 3 colors or more. 
 The goal of this project is to find an efficient algorithm for autoplay.
